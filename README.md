# Final Project

## Project Spec

- What is the general theme?
  - A To-Do app. I want to try doing a simple to-do app and start simple, if time permits I would like to add more complex implementations that could make it more interesting. My inspo is the Notion App, I really like how I can customize the functionality of a todo app.
- What is it going to do?
  - It will keep track of the to-do list, add items to the to-do list, delete when completed an item, a calendar will list the to-do item that is due at that day, and a to-do item can have attributes such as in-progress/completed, course related, when it's due, homework/quiz/project/exam, etc. 
- Who is the target audience?
  - Anyone can use the to-do app. I might focus more on the academic side, but generally anyone can use it.
- What sort of data will it manage?
  - It will manage the title of a task, course related or section (academic/chores/grocery/cleaning), date it's due, and t he progress. 
- Stretch Goals?
  - I mentioned a calendar that will list the task on when it's due, I'm not sure how complex it might be but it's one of the functionality that helps me a lot so I want to recreate that, hopefully I'll be able to!
